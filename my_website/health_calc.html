        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>As a medical practitioner, I have always wanted to build tools that fit into the Nigerian healthcare system, helping health workers work faster with fewer errors. This project is designed with the needs of Nigerian healthcare professionals in mind, focusing on accuracy, speed, and simplicity.</p>
        <p>Inspired by my daily experience in the healthcare field, I identified areas where technology can play a significant role in making calculations more efficient and reducing errors. This app is designed to provide health workers with reliable and easy-to-use tools for vital calculations.</p>
